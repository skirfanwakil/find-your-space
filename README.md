# 📍 Find Your Space - Team SIZZLERS

[cite_start]**Find Your Space** is an automated ecosystem designed to help students discover hyper-local, budget-friendly hangout spots (cafes, study stalls, and entertainment zones) based on their real-time financial capacity[cite: 15, 23].

---

## 🚀 Key Features
* [cite_start]**Wallet-Centric Filtering:** Users can set a precise budget range (e.g., ₹50 to ₹200) to find matching spots instantly[cite: 30, 31].
* [cite_start]**Live Crowdsourced Updates:** Integrated with **Google Forms**, allowing students and vendors to add new locations that reflect immediately[cite: 32, 33].
* [cite_start]**Real-Time Cloud Database:** Uses **Google Sheets** as a serverless backend for instant data updates without manual code changes[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Zero-Cost Vendor Onboarding:** Small-scale vendors like tea stalls can get "digitized" for free, reaching students without paying high commissions[cite: 35, 36].
* [cite_start]**Hyper-Local Discovery:** Highlights "Hidden Gems" around college campuses that mainstream apps often ignore[cite: 37].

## 🛠️ Google Technologies Used
* [cite_start]**Google Sheets API:** Used as a lightweight, real-time NoSQL database to store and fetch hangout data[cite: 40].
* [cite_start]**Google Forms:** Functions as a front-end "crowdsourcing" tool for seamless data ingestion[cite: 41].
* [cite_start]**Google Cloud (Local Simulation):** Used for managing environment variables and potential scaling[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]**Google Chrome DevTools:** Utilized for debugging the Flask frontend and optimizing the mobile UI[cite: 43, 44].
* [cite_start]**Google Drive:** Used for hosting and managing project documentation and assets[cite: 45].

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
[cite_start]The solution follows a scalable, three-layer architecture[cite: 81]:
1.  [cite_start]**Input Layer:** Students and vendors submit data via **Google Forms**[cite: 68, 73].
2.  [cite_start]**Processing Layer:** A **Python Flask** backend applies budget filtering logic by fetching data from **Google Sheets**[cite: 72, 74].
3.  [cite_start]**Output Layer:** A **Web UI (HTML/CSS/JS)** displays the final results to the student user[cite: 76, 80].
