### Budget-Friendly Hangout Finder (Hackathon MVP)

## Problem Statement
College students often want to hang out but struggle to find affordable cafes, restaurants, or entertainment options within their budget. At the same time, local businesses lack a simple platform to promote budget-friendly offers to students.

## Solution
Find Your Space is a lightweight web-based MVP that helps students discover nearby hangout places based on their budget and preferred category. Shopkeepers or users can submit offers through Google Forms, which automatically updates a Google Sheet used as the project database.

## Key Features
- Budget-based hangout search
- Category filtering (Cafe, Restaurant, Movie, Playstation)
- Real-time updates using Google Sheets
- Simple and accessible interface for students

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Data Handling: Pandas
- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Database: Google Sheets
- Data Collection: Google Forms

## How It Works
1. Offers are submitted through a Google Form.
2. Data is stored in a Google Sheet.
3. The Flask backend reads the Sheet as a CSV.
4. Students enter budget and category.
5. Matching hangouts are displayed instantly.
